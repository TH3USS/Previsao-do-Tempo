## About the Project

Hi, I'm Matheus ðŸ‘‹<br>
This project was created to put into practice concepts learned in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
The HTML file includes a script that makes requests to a **weather API** to get real-time information about the searched city. This project also includes styling and interactivity to enhance the user experience.

<br>  

> This project was developed as part of my learning process in consuming APIs and creating dynamic interfaces for displaying information.
